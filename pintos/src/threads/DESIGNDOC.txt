                 ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
1.static struct list blocked_list;
储存所有调用timer_sleep()函数且未被unblock的线程,当线程"休眠"了n个tick之后，从该队列中移除。

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
当传入给timer_sleep()函数的参数小于等于0时,函数直接返回。否则，记录线程应该在哪个tick苏醒.(利用全局变量ticks.)然后将线程放入上述定义的
blocked_list里面，并调用thread_block()阻塞线程。
每过一个tick便会触发一个时钟中断。在时钟中断里，我们获取当前的ticks数，然后将blocked_list扫一遍。如果当前的ticks数大于等于线程苏醒的ticks，
我们便把线程从blocked_list中移除，并且调用thread_unblock()函数解除线程的阻塞态。
>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
我们在将线程插入blcoked_list时是利用list_insert_ordered函数有序插入的。这样保证blcoked_list中的线程是按照苏醒ticks的从小到大排序的。
当我们在timer interrupt handler中遍历blocked_list时，我们不用完整的遍历，当我们一旦遍历到苏醒时间比当前ticks大的线程时，即可break。
---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?
当某一个线程进入timer_sleep函数进入timer_sleep()函数之后，会调用intr_disable()函数屏蔽中断，其他线程调用该函数必须是要在Intr_on的情况下调用，
故避免了资源竞争的问题。
>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?
当某一个线程进入timer_sleep函数进入timer_sleep()函数之后，会调用intr_disable()函数屏蔽中断，保证操作的原子性。

             PRIORITY SCHEDULING
             ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain

              ADVANCED SCHEDULER
              ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each
>> has a recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the
>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
